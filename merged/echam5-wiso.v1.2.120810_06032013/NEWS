- 2005-11-12 for DKRZ NEC SX-6 (and other NEC SX machines) the model
             is compiled by default with OpenMP support. When the model
             is used inside a single node the pure OpenMP mode delivers
             higher peformance than the pure MPI version (~ 5-6 %)
             Instead of using OMP_NUM_THREADS ECHAM5_THREADS is used
             to define the number of CPUs used by OpenMP. When the model
             should run on several nodes use one MPI Process per node.
             MPIEXPORT is not required! The number of OpenMP CPUs is
             handled inside the model.      

- 2005-09-07 echam can be used with OpenMP too. As well a hybrid
             version of MPI/OpenMP has been tested and works.
             Performance might not be perfect by now.

             Preliminary support for parallel netcdf from ANL
             is available. A bug in MPI does not allow the usage
             at DKRZ till updates in early 2006.

             The model does not need -r8 or similar switches anymore.

             HDF5 support for restart files has been removed as it can
             be handled by netcdf with large file support (requires
             netcdf-3.6.0-p1 at least).
