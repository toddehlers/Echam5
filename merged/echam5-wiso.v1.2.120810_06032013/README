INSTALLATION
------------

ECHAM5 is doing IO for the initial and restart files based on UCAR's 
netCDF (see http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf).  Take care 
that you use the right setup for your Fortran compiler when installing 
netCDF.

Configuration files for a number of operating systems and/or compilers
are provided in the config directory. Please check your system's
configuration file and edit it according to your needs. If you do any
additional system port, let us know about it.

You have to set the variable NETCDFROOT to the netCDF root directory
on your machine in the machine specific mh-'file'.  At MPI-MET this is 
for the Sun and Linux IA32 systems:

NETCDFROOT = /client

For use of the parallelized version you have to set the according path
and libary information in the respective mh-'file' which enables a 
compilation with MPI.

To compile you simply stay in the main directory echam5 and type:

configure
gmake

In case you would like to compile with the cross compiling environment
on the Linux IA32 systems at MPI-MET  or on cross.dkrz.de do:

configure --host=sx6
gmake

The make system requires GNU make. In case you have not installed this,
you need to download and install it yourself or ask your system administrator.

RUNNING
-------

To run echam5 cd to echam5/run and edit the file ham5run (or one of the
others when you need the column or middle atmosphere version).
Edit machine specific items like qsub options etc.

TEST FOR CORRECTNESS

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------

1. Configuration files for a larger set of operating systems and/or
   compiler are given in the config directory. Please check out your 
   system's configuration file. If you do any additional system port, 
   let us know about it.

2. Missing preprocessor option

   For compiler which does not have a preprocessor enabling option, we
   provide a perl script util/f2F.pl. First copy this file into the main
   echam5 directory and check the path to your perl binary at top of this
   script. It changes all .f90 to .F90. As far as we know, this files will
   be automatically preprocessed by all compilers. This script patches as 
   well the Makefiles and configure.

3. It should be noted that the Sun Workshop f90 compiler in all versions 
   prior to Forte 6 is not able to handle the model. For using ECHAM on a 
   Sun workstation another compiler is required. We develop using the 
   Fujitsu f95 compiler. At MPI-MET the compiler is available in the standard
   setup (frt).

   Note: It seems that the newest version of the Sun Compiler (Forte 6) is
         able to compile the model with very good performance, but tricky 
         compiling.
