Usage of the parallel version of echam5 may require that the Makefile,
after running configure, needs an additionel edit.

The SUN MPI library is only as dynamical library available. To allow
ld.so to find this library you need to add

-R$(MPIROOT)/lib to the MPI_LIB variable in the Makefile between
-L$(MPIROOT/lib -lmpi. The resulting line should look like:

MPI_LIB        = -L$(MPIROOT)/lib -R$(MPIROOT)/lib -lmpi
